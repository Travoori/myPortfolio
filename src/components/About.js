      <p>
        Hi! I'm Tharuni Ravoori, a dedicated and passionate Computer Science
        graduate student at Saint Louis University with hands-on experience in
        full-stack development and a strong foundation in both front-end and
        back-end technologies. My journey in software engineering has led me to
        work with diverse technologies, frameworks, and tools, and has allowed
        me to contribute to impactful projects. Previously, I worked as a
        Software Engineer at PwC, where I developed and maintained both backend
        and frontend components, ensuring seamless user experiences and
        efficient application performance.My technical expertise includes
        working with languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, along with
        frameworks like React. I am also well-versed in cloud platforms and
        DevOps tools, which allow me to build, deploy, and manage scalable
        applications. I am always eager to take on new challenges, learn
        emerging technologies, and contribute to innovative projects.
